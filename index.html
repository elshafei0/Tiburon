        <h3>General-Information</h3>
        <p>
          The car is known as the
          <span>(Tuscani, Tiburon, and Coupe)</span>. In the Middle East, it was
          called the Coupe, in Europe and America, it was known as the Tiburon,
          and in Korea, it was released as the Tuscani. <br />
          When the car was first released in 2003, which was the new rebuild,
          everything about it was changed, including the chassis. Everything was
          different from the old Coupe or the first generation. It was only
          available as a V6 and was named as <span>Tuscani Elise GT</span>. This
          was the main version of the car released at that time. <br />
          After Hyundai released this version, the car saw some success and
          gained popularity due to its design, among other factors. At that
          time, Hyundai released the 2000cc version and 1600cc version as an
          official version available in Europe and America and called
          <span> Tiburon</span>. Even in Greece, when the car was released, a
          1.6L turbo version was introduced, with a small turbo on the old
          1600cc engine. This version wasn't very popular and was also released
          in Romania as a 1.6L turbo. <br />
          Now,Let's moving on to the real differences between the two cars:
          <br />
          ðŸ“Œ Is the difference just in the engine? Can you simply swap one
          engine for anotherðŸ¤”? When we look at the car, we find that there are
          many differences. Yes, it has the same chassis and the same platform,
          similar to BMW cars where the same chassis can be used with different
          engines. The platform is designed to accommodate engines ranging from
          1600cc to 2700cc, including the V6. However, there are some
          differences. <br />
          <span>1 *First of all:*</span> The front suspension is different. The
          manual transmission for the V6 is completely different from the one in
          the 1600cc or 2000cc versions. <br />
          <span>2 *Secondly:*</span> There are many different parts underneath,
          including the left control arm, different drive shafts, and other
          components with different dimensions than those found in the 1600cc
          version. <br />
          <span>3 *Thirdly:* </span> The shocks are different, but you can swap
          them, though this might cause some issues like the car sitting
          slightly lower than normal, and the engine might move around. You
          could overlook this, but the load-bearing on the shocks is quite
          different. <br />
          <span>4 *Fourthly:*</span> The fuel pump's pressure rating is
          completely different. The pressure for the 1600cc and 2000cc versions
          won't work on the V6. There are many mechanical differences in the
          car, and there are also differences in the available options across
          different models. As for the car's acceleration, it varies by more
          than a full second due to the different engine versions, ranging from
          7.5 to 9 seconds

                modern, streamlined design. The design was based on the "HCD-II"
                concept model. The car received a design update that included a
                new front grille, updated headlights and taillights, and
                performance improvements. In 2007, the car was updated again
                with changes to the front end and bumpers, in addition to
                interior improvements.
